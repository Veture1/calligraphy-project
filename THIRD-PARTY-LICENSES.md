## Runtime Model Download

The embedding model (EmbeddingGemma-300M) is **not bundled** with this package. It is downloaded on-demand when the user runs `npx ca download-model` or `npx ca setup`.

The model is a GGUF quantization of Google's Gemma model family, hosted by ggml-org on HuggingFace. It is subject to Google's [Gemma Terms of Use](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms), which allow free use for research, development, and commercial purposes.

Key points:
- The model weights are downloaded directly by the end user
- compound-agent does not redistribute the model
- Users should review the Gemma Terms of Use before downloading
- The model download destination is the `@huggingface/transformers` package-local `.cache/` directory

## Notes

- **BlueOak-1.0.0**: A modern permissive license by the Blue Oak Council. Equivalent in permissiveness to MIT/BSD. Used by packages in the npm/Isaac Z. Schlueter ecosystem (tar, minimatch, etc.).
- **Python-2.0**: Used by the `argparse` transitive dependency. OSI-approved, permissive. Requires copyright notice retention (standard).
- **(MIT OR WTFPL)**: The `expand-template` package. We consider this MIT-licensed (choosing MIT from the dual license).
