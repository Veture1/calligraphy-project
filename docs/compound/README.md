# Compound Agent

A learning system for Claude Code that captures, indexes, and retrieves lessons learned during development sessions -- so the same mistakes are not repeated.

---

## What is compound-agent?

Compound-agent is a Go CLI that integrates with Claude Code. When Claude makes a mistake and gets corrected, or discovers a useful pattern, that knowledge is stored as a **memory item** in `.claude/lessons/index.jsonl`. Future sessions search this memory before planning and implementing.

The system uses:

- **JSONL storage** (`.claude/lessons/index.jsonl`) as the git-tracked source of truth
- **SQLite + FTS5** (`.claude/.cache/lessons.sqlite`) as a rebuildable search index
- **Semantic embeddings** (ca-embed Rust daemon with local model) for vector similarity search
- **Claude Code hooks** to inject memory at session start, before compaction, and on tool failures

Memory items have four types: `lesson`, `solution`, `pattern`, and `preference`. Each has a trigger, an insight, tags, severity, and optional citations.

## Quick start

```bash
# Initialize in your project:
ca init

# Full setup:
ca setup

# Install for specific harnesses (default is claude):
ca setup --harness codex,agy

# Verify installation:
ca doctor
```

`setup --harness` accepts `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, and `goose` (comma-separated and/or repeatable). The `agy` target writes a compound protocol section to `AGENTS.md` for the Antigravity CLI (`agy`), the functional loop engine that replaces the standalone gemini CLI. The deprecated `gemini` and `antigravity` aliases still resolve to `agy` with a warning.

### What `init` does

1. Creates `.claude/lessons/` directory and empty `index.jsonl`
2. Updates `AGENTS.md` with a compound-agent section
3. Adds a reference to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
4. Creates `.claude/plugin.json` manifest
5. Installs agent templates, workflow commands, phase skills, and agent role skills
6. Installs a git pre-commit hook (lesson capture reminder)
7. Installs Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, PreCompact, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUseFailure, PostToolUse, PreToolUse, Stop)
8. For pnpm projects: auto-configures `onlyBuiltDependencies` for native addons

`setup` does everything `init` does. The embedding model is managed separately by the embed daemon.

## Running epics

Each epic's spec lives as a file at `docs/specs/<epic-id>-<slug>.md` -- the single source of truth that every workflow phase reads. The beads epic description holds only a pointer stub to that file.

To build epics autonomously:

- `ca loop --implementer <name>` runs an epic loop via `claude` (default), `goose` (open/local models), `codex` (gpt-5.5-codex), or `agy` (gemini-3.1-pro).
- The architect offers two implementation modes at its Launch gate: a detached infinity loop (`ca loop` in a `screen` session) for long unattended runs, or live orchestration (the architect drives epics through cook-it in-session, sequentially and autonomously).
