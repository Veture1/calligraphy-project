## How to Add Research

Use `/compound:get-a-phd` to produce new research documents. The command:
1. Analyzes beads epics for knowledge gaps
2. Checks all `docs/` for existing coverage
3. Proposes PhD topics for user confirmation
4. Spawns parallel researcher subagents
5. Stores output at `docs/research/<topic>/<slug>.md`

## How Agents Use Research

Skills and agents reference research via `## Literature` sections. Agents can also query indexed knowledge:
```bash
ca knowledge "relevant query"  # Search docs knowledge base
ca search "relevant query"     # Search lessons memory
```
