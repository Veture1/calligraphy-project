# Subagent Pipeline

## Overview

Every implementation MUST follow the mandatory subagent sequence. Work is NOT complete until `/implementation-reviewer` returns APPROVED.

## Mandatory Sequence

| Order | Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `/invariant-designer` | Define invariants | Before writing ANY code |
| 2 | `/cct-subagent` | Inject mistake-derived test requirements | After invariants, before tests |
| 3 | `/test-first-enforcer` | Verify TDD adherence | Before implementing |
| 4 | `/property-test-generator` | Generate property tests | For edge cases |
| 5 | `/anti-cargo-cult-reviewer` | Reject fake tests | During test review |
| 6 | `/module-boundary-reviewer` | Validate module design | After implementation |
| 7 | `/drift-detector` | Check for constraint drift | After boundary review |
| 8 | `/implementation-reviewer` | **FINAL authority** | Before marking complete |
| 9 | External reviewers (optional) | Cross-model review (Gemini/Codex) | After approval, if configured |

## Closed-Loop Process

```
+------------------+
| 1. INVARIANTS    |  /invariant-designer
| Define what must |  - Data invariants
| always be true   |  - Safety properties
+--------+---------+  - Liveness properties
         |
         v
+------------------+
| 2. CCT INJECTION |  /cct-subagent
| Inject test reqs |  - Match past mistakes
| from past lessons|  - REQUIRED / SUGGESTED tests
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| 3. TESTS FIRST   |  /test-first-enforcer
| Write failing    |  /property-test-generator
| tests that verify|  /anti-cargo-cult-reviewer
| invariants       |
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| 4. IMPLEMENT     |  /module-boundary-reviewer
| Minimal code to  |  - One test at a time
| pass tests       |  - NEVER modify tests to pass
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| 5. DRIFT CHECK   |  /drift-detector
| Verify alignment |  - Invariants, ADRs
| with constraints |  - Architecture decisions
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| 6. REVIEW        |  /implementation-reviewer
| Independent gate |  - Validates ALL criteria
| FINAL authority  |  - Cannot be bypassed
+--------+---------+
         |
    +----+----+
    |         |
 APPROVED  REJECTED
    |         |
    v         v
+-------+  +------------------+
| DONE  |  | FIX ALL ISSUES   |
+-------+  | Return to stage  |
           | 2, 3, or 4       |
           +--------+---------+
                    |
                    +-------> (loop back)
```

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Define Invariants
Use `/invariant-designer` to document what must be true:
- Data invariants (what must always be true about data)
- Safety properties (what must never happen)
- Liveness properties (what must eventually happen)

### Phase 2: CCT Injection
Use `/cct-subagent` to inject mistake-derived test requirements:
- Read CCT patterns synthesized from past lessons
- Match patterns against the current task's domain and files
- Output REQUIRED or SUGGESTED test requirements for test-first-enforcer

### Phase 3: Write Tests FIRST
- Use `/test-first-enforcer` to verify TDD adherence
- Use `/property-test-generator` for edge cases
- Use `/anti-cargo-cult-reviewer` to reject fake tests
- Tests MUST fail before implementation exists

### Phase 4: Implement
- Write minimal code to pass tests
- One test at a time
- **NEVER** modify tests to make them pass
- Use `/module-boundary-reviewer` for design validation

### Phase 5: Drift Check
Use `/drift-detector` to verify implementation alignment:
- Compare implementation against documented invariants and ADRs
- Check module boundaries and data flows match architecture
- Flag any deviation, even if tests pass

### Phase 6: Review (Closed Loop)
- Call `/implementation-reviewer` for final approval
- If **REJECTED**: Fix ALL issues listed, return to appropriate stage, resubmit
- If **APPROVED**: Work is complete
- **Do NOT argue** -- criteria are objective

## Scenario Coverage

The `scenario-coverage-reviewer` is a medium-tier reviewer that verifies test files cover the scenario table generated during spec-dev Phase 3. It uses heuristic AI-driven matching — not mechanical traceability.

| Category | Matching Heuristic |
|----------|-------------------|
| happy | Tests exercising the main success path |
| error | Tests with error triggers, rejection assertions, or exception expectations |
| boundary | Tests with min/max/edge values or property tests with constrained generators |
| combinatorial | Parameterized tests, table-driven tests, or pairwise property tests |
| adversarial | Tests with invalid input, malformed data, or security-focused assertions |

**Output**: `SCENARIO_GAP` (P1, no test), `PARTIAL` (P2, trigger tested but outcome not asserted), `COVERED`, and a summary line `X/Y scenarios covered (Z%)`.

## Security Arc

The security-reviewer (core 4) can escalate to 5 on-demand specialist skills for deep analysis.

| Specialist | Trigger | Reference Doc |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `/security-injection` | SQL/cmd concat, template interpolation in queries | `injection-patterns.md` |
| `/security-secrets` | Hardcoded strings matching key patterns, committed .env | `secrets-checklist.md` |
| `/security-auth` | Route handlers missing middleware, IDOR patterns | `auth-patterns.md` |
| `/security-data` | Logging calls with request objects, verbose errors | `data-exposure.md` |
| `/security-deps` | Lockfile changes, new deps, postinstall scripts | `dependency-security.md` |

**Escalation flow**: security-reviewer detects suspicious pattern -> spawns specialist via SendMessage within the review AgentTeam -> specialist performs deep trace analysis -> reports findings back with P0-P3 severity.

**P0 findings block merge.** No exceptions. P1 findings require explicit acknowledgment.

All reference docs are at `docs/research/security/` (source repo) or `docs/compound/research/security/` (consumer repos after `ca setup`).

## Inviolable TDD Rules

- Tests must exist BEFORE implementation
- Real data, real execution (no mocked business logic)
- Tests must verify meaningful properties
- ALL subagents in sequence must be used
- Work is NOT complete until `/implementation-reviewer` returns APPROVED
- On rejection, fix ALL issues before resubmitting (not just some)

## Optional: External Reviewers

After `/implementation-reviewer` approves, configured external reviewers run as **advisory (non-blocking)** cross-model checks.

**Setup**: `ca reviewer enable gemini` or `ca reviewer enable codex`
**Config**: `.claude/compound-agent.json` — `{ "externalReviewers": ["gemini", "codex"] }`

External reviewers:
- Check tool availability via `command -v` (graceful skip if not installed)
- Feed beads issue context + `git diff` to the external tool in headless mode
- Present findings with severity tags (P1/P2/P3)
- Never block the pipeline — findings are informational only

## Workflow Enforcement Gates

When using `/compound:cook-it` to chain all 5 workflow phases, mechanical gates prevent phase-skipping:

| Gate | Location | Checks |
|------|----------|--------|
| PHASE GATE 3 | Between Work and Review | All work tasks closed, `bd ready` shows review task |
| PHASE GATE 4 | Between Review and Compound | Review task closed, `bd ready` shows compound task |
| FINAL GATE | After Compound | `ca verify-gates <epic-id>` confirms review + compound tasks closed |

### `ca verify-gates <epic-id>`

Parses the epic's dependency graph and checks that both a `Review:` task and a `Compound:` task exist and are closed. Returns pass/fail for each gate.

```bash
ca verify-gates beads-abc123
# Review task .............. PASS (beads-def456 closed)
# Compound task ............ PASS (beads-ghi789 closed)
```

Both gates must pass before closing the epic.

## Subagent Authority

The `/implementation-reviewer` has FINAL authority:

**Can Do**:
- REJECT implementations that do not meet criteria
- REQUIRE specific fixes
- PREVENT completion of substandard work

**Cannot Be**:
- Bypassed (no exceptions)
- Overridden (criteria are objective)
- Rushed (quality over speed)
