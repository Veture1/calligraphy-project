# Compound Agent - Architecture V2

## Vision

A semantically-intelligent workflow plugin for Claude Code that replaces the current disconnected toolchain (compound-agent + compound-engineering + manual coordination) with a unified system where **every unit of work makes subsequent work easier**.

The core insight: compound-engineering's workflow is powerful but its knowledge storage (grep on markdown files) doesn't scale. Our compound-agent's semantic retrieval is powerful but its scope (just lessons) is too narrow. Compound-agent combines the best of both: **compound-engineering's workflow cycle** powered by **semantic memory with vector search**.

---

## Philosophy

**Each unit of work should compound.** Not just by storing files, but by building a searchable, ranked, semantically-accessible knowledge base that gets smarter with every cycle.

### Principles

| Principle | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Semantic over static** | Vector search replaces grep. Only relevant knowledge enters context. |
| **Capture aggressively, prune later** | Lower bar for capture. Compaction cleans up over time. |
| **Beads as foundation** | Issue tracking, dependency graph, git-backed persistence. We build on top. |
| **Agent teams for quality** | Inter-communicating agents at each phase. Cost is not a concern. |
| **Explicit workflow phases** | User triggers phases via slash commands. System doesn't auto-decide complexity. |
| **Skills guide process, knowledge informs content** | SKILL.md defines HOW phases work. Memory items provide WHAT was learned. |

---

## Three-Layer Architecture

```
LAYER 3: WORKFLOWS
  Slash commands (/compound:spec-dev, /compound:plan, etc.)
  Agent teams at each phase (with inter-communication)
  TDD pair model (adaptive per task complexity)

LAYER 2: SEMANTIC MEMORY
  Unified store: lessons + solutions + patterns + preferences
  JSONL source of truth + SQLite index + vector embeddings
  Ranked retrieval: semantic similarity + boosts (recency, severity, confirmation)

LAYER 1: BEADS (Foundation)
  Issue tracking + dependency graph
  Git-backed persistence + distributed sync
  Molecules for workflow orchestration
```

### Layer 1: Beads (Foundation)

Beads is the storage and orchestration backbone. We don't replace it; we build on it.

**What beads provides:**
- `bd ready` -- dependency-aware task readiness
- `bd create` / `bd close` -- issue lifecycle
- `bd sync` -- git-backed distributed sync
- Molecules / wisps -- persistent vs ephemeral work units
- Hash-based IDs -- no distributed coordination needed
- 3-way merge -- field-specific conflict resolution

**How compound-agent uses beads:**
- Each workflow phase creates/updates beads issues
- Agent team tasks map to beads issues
- The compound phase creates beads issues for follow-up work
- Beads' dependency graph orchestrates task ordering within agent teams

### Layer 2: Semantic Memory (The Intelligence Layer)

The evolution of compound-agent's lesson store into a unified knowledge base.

**What gets stored:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `lesson` | Mistake -> insight | "Polars 10x faster than pandas for large files" |
| `solution` | Problem -> resolution | "Auth 401 fix: add X-Request-ID header" |
| `pattern` | Recurring practice | "Always run tests before commit in this repo" |
| `preference` | User/project choice | "Use uv over pip" |

All types share one store, one schema, one search mechanism. A query returns the most relevant items regardless of type.

**Storage model:**

```
.claude/
  lessons/
    index.jsonl          # Source of truth (git-tracked, append-only)
    archive/             # Compacted old items
  .cache/
    lessons.sqlite       # Rebuildable index with FTS5 + embeddings (gitignored)
```

This is the same proven three-layer model from beads (fast local DB + portable JSONL + git distribution) applied to knowledge.

**Schema (extended from compound-agent):**

```go
type MemoryItem struct {
    // Identity
    ID   string `json:"id"`   // Hash-based, like beads
    Type string `json:"type"` // "lesson" | "solution" | "pattern" | "preference"

    // Core content (embeddings generated from trigger + insight)
    Trigger  string `json:"trigger"`            // What caused/prompted this
    Insight  string `json:"insight"`            // What was learned
    Evidence string `json:"evidence,omitempty"` // Supporting evidence

    // Metadata
    Tags     []string `json:"tags"`
    Severity string   `json:"severity"` // "high" | "medium" | "low"
    Source   string   `json:"source"`   // How captured
    Context  *struct {
        Tool   string `json:"tool"`
        Intent string `json:"intent"`
    } `json:"context,omitempty"`
    Citation *struct {
        File   string `json:"file"`
        Line   int    `json:"line,omitempty"`
        Commit string `json:"commit,omitempty"`
    } `json:"citation,omitempty"`
    Created   string `json:"created"`
    Confirmed bool   `json:"confirmed"`

    // Lifecycle
    RetrievalCount  int      `json:"retrievalCount"`
    Supersedes      []string `json:"supersedes"`
    Related         []string `json:"related"`
    CompactionLevel int      `json:"compactionLevel"` // 0, 1, or 2

    // Type-specific
    Pattern *struct {
        Bad  string `json:"bad"`
        Good string `json:"good"`
    } `json:"pattern,omitempty"` // For patterns/lessons
}
```

**Retrieval:**

```
boost  = severity_boost * recency_boost * confirmation_boost
         clamped to max 1.8
score  = vector_similarity(query, item) * boost

severity_boost:     high=1.5, medium=1.0, low=0.8
recency_boost:      last 30d=1.2, older=1.0
confirmation_boost: confirmed=1.3, unconfirmed=1.0
```

**Capture quality (lower bar, prune later):**
- Novelty check: skip if >0.98 cosine similarity with existing item
- Specificity check: reject obviously vague items
- No actionability gate (capture more, prune later)
- User confirmation for high-severity items only
- Aggressive compaction: archive items >90 days with 0 retrievals

### Layer 3: Workflows

The compound engineering cycle, triggered by explicit slash commands.

**Commands:**

| Command | Phase | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/compound:spec-dev` | Spec Dev | Develop precise specifications through Socratic dialogue |
| `/compound:plan` | Plan | Create detailed plan with semantic retrieval |
| `/compound:work` | Work | Execute with agent teams |
| `/compound:review` | Review | Multi-agent review with inter-communication |
| `/compound:compound` | Compound | Capture knowledge, feed back into memory |
| `/compound:cook-it` | All | Chain all phases sequentially |
| `ca phase-check` | All | Phase state management (init/status/clean/gate) |

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Spec Dev (`/compound:spec-dev`)

**Purpose**: Develop precise, unambiguous specifications through Socratic dialogue, EARS notation, and Mermaid diagrams. Replaces the former brainstorm phase with a structured 4-phase spec development process.

**Process:**
1. **Explore**: User describes the goal. Agent maps stakeholders, constraints, and domain concepts (mindmap diagrams)
2. **Understand**: Iterative Socratic dialogue to crystallize requirements using EARS notation. Agent challenges vagueness and ambiguity
3. **Specify**: Assemble formal spec with EARS requirements, Mermaid diagrams, trade-off documentation, and a glossary
4. **Hand off**: Create beads epic with tasks derived from spec. Downstream skills (plan, work, review) are spec-aware

**Agent model**: Single agent (lead) with user dialogue. Research subagents for domain exploration.

**Memory integration**: Search memory for related lessons/solutions before asking questions. Past specs and decisions inform current work.

### Phase 2: Plan (`/compound:plan`)

**Purpose**: Create a detailed technical plan with blocking tasks, enriched by semantic memory.

**Process:**
1. Read spec-dev output (if exists)
2. Semantic memory search: retrieve relevant lessons, solutions, patterns
3. Spawn research agent team:
   - Repo analyst: codebase patterns and architecture
   - Memory analyst: deep dive into related memory items
   - (Optional) External researcher: docs, best practices
4. Synthesize research into plan
5. Create beads issues with dependencies from plan items
6. Output: beads tasks with rich context, ready for `/compound:work`

**Agent model**: Small team (2-4 research agents). Lead synthesizes.

**Memory integration**: Retrieved items injected into plan. Phase skill (SKILL.md) guides what to search for.

### Phase 3: Work (`/compound:work`)

**Purpose**: Execute the plan using agent teams with TDD.

**Process:**
1. Read plan + beads issues (`bd ready` for available work)
2. Assess task complexity -> determine agent model (adaptive TDD):

| Complexity | Agent Model |
|------------|-------------|
| Trivial | Single agent, no TDD |
| Simple | Sequential TDD: test-writer creates tests, hands off to implementer |
| Complex | Iterative TDD: test-writer and implementer ping-pong, sync on interface |

3. Lead in delegate mode: coordinates, doesn't code
4. Each agent gets:
   - Their beads task context
   - Relevant memory items (via semantic search on task description)
   - Phase skill (TDD workflow instructions)
5. Agents work, communicate when tasks overlap
6. Incremental commits as tests pass
7. Output: implemented code with passing tests

**Agent model**: Team with TDD pairs (adaptive). Lead delegates.

**Memory integration**: Each agent gets relevant memory items injected. If an agent encounters a known issue, the memory provides the solution directly.

### Phase 4: Review (`/compound:review`)

**Purpose**: Multi-agent review with inter-communication. Findings become compound input.

**Process:**
1. Spawn reviewer agent team (specialized roles):
   - Security reviewer
   - Architecture reviewer
   - Performance reviewer
   - Test coverage reviewer
   - Code simplicity reviewer
   - (Project-specific reviewers based on tech stack)
2. Reviewers CAN communicate with each other (agent teams feature)
   - Security finding that impacts architecture -> direct message
   - Performance concern that needs test -> direct message
3. Lead synthesizes findings into P1/P2/P3
4. Mandatory gate: implementation-reviewer has final authority
5. P1 findings block completion
6. Output: review report + action items as beads issues

**Agent model**: Full team (5-10 reviewers). Inter-communication enabled.

**Memory integration**: Reviewers check memory for known issues in the codebase. Past review findings inform current review.

### Phase 5: Compound (`/compound:compound`)

**Purpose**: Capture what was learned. Feed back into semantic memory.

**Process:**
1. Spawn compound analysis team:
   - Context Analyzer: summarize what happened (plan + diff + tests)
   - Lesson Extractor: identify mistakes, corrections, discoveries
   - Pattern Matcher: find recurring patterns across sessions
   - Solution Writer: formulate structured memory items
2. Quality filter (lower bar):
   - Novelty check (>0.98 cosine similarity = skip)
   - Basic specificity check
   - No actionability gate
3. Propose memory items to user
4. High-severity items require user confirmation
5. Low/medium-severity items auto-stored (pruned later)
6. Update existing items: set `supersedes` and `related` links
7. Output: new memory items in `index.jsonl`

**Agent model**: Small team (3-4 analysts). Lead writes final items.

**Memory integration**: This phase PRODUCES memory items. The compound loop closes here.

## The Compound Loop (Core Innovation)

```
COMPOUND writes to MEMORY
    |
    v
MEMORY is searched by PLAN
    |
    v
PLAN creates context for WORK
    |
    v
WORK produces artifacts for REVIEW
    |
    v
REVIEW generates findings for COMPOUND
    |
    v
COMPOUND writes to MEMORY  <-- loop closes
```

Every cycle through the loop makes subsequent cycles smarter:
- A bug found in review becomes a lesson
- That lesson surfaces during planning of similar work
- The plan accounts for the known issue
- Work avoids the mistake
- Review confirms the improvement
- Compound captures the meta-lesson: "this pattern of proactive checking works"

---

## Skill System

Skills define HOW each phase works. They are SKILL.md files, not stored knowledge.

```
.claude/skills/
  compound/
    spec-dev/
      SKILL.md       # How to develop specs, EARS notation, Mermaid diagrams
      references/
        spec-guide.md  # Quick reference (EARS, diagrams, ambiguity, trade-offs)
    plan/
      SKILL.md       # How to plan, what agents to spawn, what to search
    work/
      SKILL.md       # TDD workflow, team structure, execution patterns
    review/
      SKILL.md       # Reviewer roles, communication patterns, quality gates
    compound/
      SKILL.md       # What to capture, quality filters, item schema
```

**Skills vs Knowledge:**
- Skills = process instructions (HOW to do something). Static, authored by humans.
- Knowledge = learned information (WHAT was learned). Dynamic, captured by the system.
- Skills guide the workflow. Knowledge informs the content.

Skills can reference each other and can be project-specific or shared.

## Migration from Compound-Agent V1

The transition preserves all existing investment:

| Current | Compound Agent | Migration |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| `lessons/index.jsonl` | `lessons/index.jsonl` | Schema extension (backward compatible) |
| `lessons.sqlite` | `lessons.sqlite` | Rebuild from JSONL |
| `learn` CLI | `compound-agent capture` | Alias preserved |
| `search` CLI | `compound-agent search` | Same interface |
| All 1000+ tests | Kept | Test paths updated |

**Phase 1**: Rename + extend schema (non-breaking)
**Phase 2**: Add workflow commands + agent definitions
**Phase 3**: Add agent team support for each phase
**Phase 4**: Polish, iterate, compound

## What This Supersedes

| Before | After | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| compound-agent standalone | compound-agent memory module | Same functionality, broader scope |
| compound-engineering-plugin | compound-agent workflow | Semantic retrieval > grep on markdown |
| Manual agent coordination | Agent teams with beads integration | Structured, trackable, reproducible |
| docs/solutions/ markdown dumps | Structured JSONL with embeddings | Searchable, ranked, scalable |
| Static skill loading | Dynamic memory retrieval | No context explosion |

---

## Open Questions (For Future Exploration)

1. **Cross-repo knowledge sharing**: How to share memory items between projects without copy-paste?
2. **Skill marketplace**: Should phase skills be shareable like OpenClaw's ClawHub?
3. **Agent CVs**: Should we track which agents/patterns worked well (like Gastown)?
4. **Molecule integration**: Can beads molecules replace our workflow orchestration?
5. **Multi-runtime support**: Should compound-agent work with non-Claude agents (Codex, Cursor)?

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Knowledge compounds**: Each completed workflow cycle measurably improves future cycles
2. **Context efficiency**: Memory items add <3K tokens per agent (semantic retrieval, not bulk loading)
3. **Workflow adoption**: User naturally uses `/compound:plan` instead of ad-hoc planning
4. **Capture rate**: More knowledge items captured per session than current compound-agent
5. **Retrieval precision**: Retrieved items are relevant >80% of the time
6. **Zero friction migration**: All existing compound-agent functionality preserved
