## 1. Problem Statement

The compound-agent pipeline has strong foundations (lesson system, 24-agent review, infinity loop) but underutilizes its own knowledge during reviews, lacks runtime verification, and has workflow gaps in acceptance criteria, failure escalation, and research triggering. A recent infinity loop audit surfaced: *"14 well-tested components that don't actually talk to each other correctly"* — confirming that integration testing is a structural blind spot.

## 2. System-Level EARS Requirements

### 2.1 Lesson-Calibrated Reviewers (LCR)

| ID | Pattern | Requirement |
|----|---------|-------------|
| LCR-1 | Event | When a review subagent begins its review pass, the system shall instruct the subagent to query `ca search` with the current review context (file paths, change summary, domain keywords) and use matching lessons as calibration context. |
| LCR-2 | Event | When a review subagent begins its review pass, the system shall instruct the subagent to consult relevant files in `docs/research/` for methodology references applicable to its review domain. |
| LCR-3 | Unwanted | If a reviewer produces a finding that contradicts a previously captured lesson (severity >= high), the system shall flag the contradiction for human review. |

### 2.2 Runtime Verification Skill (RV)

| ID | Pattern | Requirement |
|----|---------|-------------|
| RV-1 | Event | When the review phase encounters a project with a web UI or HTTP API, the runtime-verifier skill shall generate ephemeral Playwright/Puppeteer test scripts that exercise the running application. |
| RV-2 | Ubiquitous | The runtime-verifier skill shall ship with research references from `docs/research/q-and-a/runtime-verification.md` and code snippet examples demonstrating common test patterns (API contract, UI smoke, state transition). |
| RV-3 | Event | When ephemeral tests complete, the system shall report results as review findings classified by severity (P0-P3). |
| RV-4 | Unwanted | If the runtime-verifier cannot start the application under test (missing dependencies, build failure), it shall report a P1 finding with diagnostic details rather than silently skipping verification. |
| RV-5 | Event | When the runtime-verifier generates test code, the agent shall use Playwright/Puppeteer library APIs (code generation), not browser MCP tools (direct control). |

### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria Enhancement (AC)

| ID | Pattern | Requirement |
|----|---------|-------------|
| AC-1 | Event | When the plan phase creates tasks from an epic, it shall extract testable acceptance criteria from the EARS requirements in the epic description and write them to an explicit `## Acceptance Criteria` section in the epic description. |
| AC-2 | Ubiquitous | The review phase shall check implementation against the acceptance criteria in the epic description before producing findings. |
| AC-3 | Unwanted | If the review phase cannot find an `## Acceptance Criteria` section in the epic description, the system shall flag this as a P1 process finding. |
| AC-4 | Event | When the work phase begins on a task, the agent shall read the parent epic's acceptance criteria to understand what "done" means for the task. |

### 2.4 Integration Verification Epic (IV)

| ID | Pattern | Requirement |
|----|---------|-------------|
| IV-1 | Event | When the architect materializes epics (Phase 4), it shall create a final "Integration Verification" epic that depends on ALL other materialized epics. |
| IV-2 | State | While composing the integration verification epic, the architect shall scope testing depth proportionally: light smoke tests for ≤3 epics with minimal interfaces, full integration suite for >3 epics or complex cross-boundary contracts. |
| IV-3 | Ubiquitous | The integration verification epic shall go through the full cook-it pipeline (spec-dev → plan → work → review → compound) like any other epic. |
| IV-4 | Event | When the integration verification epic's plan phase runs, it shall produce tasks that test cross-epic interfaces identified in the architect's interface contracts. |
| IV-5 | Unwanted | If an integration test reveals a cross-boundary failure, the system shall create a new bug bead with dependencies pointing to the originating epics. |

### 2.5 Smarter Failure Escalation (FE)

| ID | Pattern | Requirement |
|----|---------|-------------|
| FE-1 | Event | When a tool fails ≥3 times on the same target within a session, the `post-tool-failure` hook shall automatically run `ca search` with the error message and target context. |
| FE-2 | Event | When `ca search` returns matching lessons (similarity > threshold), the hook shall inject the top 3 matching lessons into the hook output for the agent to consume. |
| FE-3 | Unwanted | If `ca search` returns no matches, the hook shall fall back to the existing generic tip behavior (no regression). |

### 2.6 get-a-phd Auto-Trigger (PhD)

| ID | Pattern | Requirement |
|----|---------|-------------|
| PhD-1 | Event | When architect Phase 1 (Socratic) begins, the system shall search `ca search` and `docs/research/` for existing domain knowledge relevant to the current specification. |
| PhD-2 | State | While domain familiarity is assessed as low (< 3 relevant results from combined search), the system shall recommend triggering full get-a-phd research and explain why. |
| PhD-3 | Optional | Where the architect determines sufficient domain knowledge already exists, the system shall proceed with existing research without triggering get-a-phd. |
| PhD-4 | Event | When get-a-phd completes research, the system shall store structured research artifacts in `docs/research/` so they persist across sessions and survive context resets. |

### 2.7 Per-Phase Context Resets (DEFERRED)

> **Status**: Backlog. Not in scope for v1.
> **Concept**: Spawn fresh Claude sessions per cook-it phase within infinity loop, with structured handoff artifacts (beads + diff + review report).
> **Rationale**: Deferred because the workflow implications need more investigation. Will be tracked as a standalone backlog epic.

## 6. Non-Goals (v1)

- Per-phase context resets (deferred to backlog epic)
- Simplification audit of reviewer count (Point 3 — skipped per user)
- Committed test files from runtime verifier (ephemeral only in v1)
- Shipping pre-built lesson examples (subagents query dynamically instead)
