</p>

AI coding agents forget everything between sessions. Each session starts with whatever context was prepared for it — nothing more. Because agents carry no persistent state, that state must live in the codebase itself, and any agent that reads the same well-structured context should be able to pick up where another left off. Compound Agent implements this: it captures mistakes once, retrieves them precisely when relevant, and can hand entire systems to an autonomous loop that processes epic by epic with no human intervention.

## What gets installed

`ca setup` injects a complete development environment into your repository:

| Component | What ships |
|-----------|-----------|
| 16 slash commands | `/compound:architect`, `cook-it`, `spec-dev`, `plan`, `work`, `review`, `compound`, `learn-that`, `check-that`, and more |
| 26 agent role skills | TDD pair, drift detector, audit, research specialist, external reviewers, and more |
| 7 automatic hooks | Fire on session start, prompt submit, tool use, tool failure, pre-compact, phase guard, and session stop |
| 5 phase skill files | Full workflow instructions for `architect`, `spec-dev`, `cook-it`, `work`, and `review` |
| 5 deployed docs | Workflow reference, CLI reference, skills guide, integration guide, and overview |

This is not a memory plugin bolted onto a text editor. It is the environment your agents run inside.

## How it works

Two memory systems persist across sessions:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/diagram-1.png" alt="A task session between two memory systems: Lessons (JSONL + SQLite with semantic + keyword search) are retrieved before and captured after each task. Knowledge (project docs chunked and embedded) is queried on demand." width="700">
</p>

- **Lessons** — mistakes, corrections, and patterns stored as git-tracked JSONL, indexed in SQLite FTS5 with local embeddings for hybrid search. Retrieved at the start of each task, captured at the end.
- **Knowledge** — project documentation chunked and embedded for semantic retrieval. Any phase can query it on demand.

Each task runs through five phases, with review findings looping back to rework. Each phase runs as its own slash command so instructions are re-injected fresh (surviving context compaction):

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/diagram-2.png" alt="Inside a task: five phases (Spec, Plan, Work, Review, Compound) connected in sequence with a feedback loop from Review back to Work. Each phase runs as its own slash command with fresh instructions. Lessons are retrieved at start and captured at end. Knowledge is queryable from any phase." width="700">
</p>

Each cycle through the loop makes the next one smarter. The architect step is optional — use it for systems too large for a single feature cycle.

## Three principles

These constraints follow from how AI agents work, and each one maps to a layer of the architecture.

| Principle | Without it | Layer |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Memory** | Same mistakes every session. Architectural decisions re-derived from scratch. Knowledge locked in human heads where agents cannot reach it. | Semantic Memory |
| **Feedback loops** | Agents cannot verify their own work. Manual review is the only quality gate. Drift is the default at agent-scale output. | Structured Workflows |
| **Navigable structure** | Context windows fill with orientation work. Agents make unverifiable assumptions about dependencies and ordering. | Beads Foundation |

The three are not independent. Memory without feedback loops is unreliable. Feedback without navigable structure fires blindly. The system works as a whole or not at all.

## Is this for you?

**"It keeps making the same mistake every session."**
Capture it once. Compound Agent surfaces it automatically before the agent repeats it.

**"I explained our auth pattern three sessions ago. Now it's reimplementing from scratch."**
Architectural decisions persist as searchable lessons. Next session, they inject into context before planning starts.

**"My agent uses pandas when we standardised on Polars months ago."**
Preferences survive across sessions and projects. Once captured, they appear at the right moment.

**"Code reviews keep catching the same class of bugs."**
24 specialised review agents (security, performance, architecture, test coverage) run in parallel. Findings feed back as lessons that become test requirements in future work.

**"I have no idea what my agent actually learned or if it's reliable."**
`ca list` shows all captured knowledge. `ca stats` shows health. `ca wrong <id>` invalidates bad lessons. Everything is git-tracked JSONL — you can read, diff, and audit it.

**"I want structured phases, not just 'go build this'."**
Five workflow phases (spec-dev, plan, work, review, compound) with mandatory gates between them. Each phase searches memory and docs for relevant context before starting.

**"My agent doesn't read the project docs before making decisions."**
`ca knowledge "auth flow"` runs hybrid search (vector + keyword) over your indexed docs. Agents query it automatically during planning — ADRs, specs, and standards surface before code gets written.

**"I want to hand a large system spec to the machine and walk away."**
`/compound:architect` decomposes it into epics. `ca loop` processes them autonomously.

## Levels of use

### Level 1 — Memory only

Two minutes to set up. Works in any session without changing your existing workflow.

```bash
# Capture a mistake or preference
ca learn "Always use Polars, not pandas in this project" --severity high
ca learn "Auth 401 fix: add X-Request-ID header" --type solution

# Search manually anytime
ca search "polars"

# Or let hooks surface it automatically — no command needed
```

### Level 2 — Structured workflow

One command runs all five phases on a single feature: spec-dev, plan, work (TDD + agent team), review (24 agents), and compound (capture lessons).

```bash
/compound:cook-it "Add rate limiting to the API"
```

Run phases individually when you want more control:

```bash
/compound:spec-dev "Add rate limiting"    # Socratic dialogue → EARS spec → Mermaid diagrams
/compound:plan                            # Tasks enriched by memory search
/compound:work                            # TDD with agent team
/compound:review                          # 24 parallel agents with severity gates
/compound:compound                        # Capture what was learned
```

spec-dev writes each per-epic spec to `docs/specs/<epic-id>-<slug>.md` as the single source of truth; the beads epic description holds only a pointer stub. plan appends the Acceptance Criteria and Verification Contract to that file, and work, review, and compound read from it (falling back to the legacy epic-description spec when no file exists). Material changes are logged in an `## Amendments` section. Specs stay readable and usable even outside the beads tooling.

### Level 3 — Factory mode

For systems too large for a single feature cycle. `/compound:architect` decomposes the system; `ca loop` processes the resulting epics autonomously.

```bash
# Step 1: decompose the system into epics
/compound:architect "Multi-tenant SaaS: auth, billing, API, admin dashboard"
# → Socratic dialogue → system-level EARS spec → DDD decomposition
# → N epics with dependency graph, interface contracts, and scope boundaries

# Step 2: generate and run the loop
ca loop --reviewers claude-sonnet --review-every 3
./.compound-agent/infinity-loop.sh
# → Processes each epic in dependency order: spec-dev → plan → work → review → compound
# → Captures lessons after every cycle, improving subsequent cycles
```

## The infinity loop

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/diagram-3.png" alt="ca loop chains tasks in dependency order: Task 1 through Task 4, each running a full cycle in a fresh session. Cross-model review (R) gates between tasks. Failed tasks retry automatically. Tasks can escalate to human-required. Generated bash script with deterministic orchestration." width="700">
</p>

`ca loop` generates a bash script that processes your beads epics sequentially, running the full cook-it cycle on each one. No human intervention required between epics.

`--implementer` selects the engine that runs each epic: **claude** (default), **goose**, **codex**, or **agy**. With the default claude implementer, the backend is `claude --bg` (subscription-billed; requires accepting the bypass-permissions disclaimer once: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`); use `--backend p` or `CA_BACKEND=p` for the legacy `claude -p` (pay-per-token) path. **goose** runs open/local models via Goose (e.g. `--model ollama/qwen2.5-coder:14b` or `deepseek/deepseek-chat`; for the ollama provider the loop auto-exports `GOOSE_TOOLSHIM=1`). **codex** drives the OpenAI Codex CLI (default model `gpt-5.5-codex`, dispatched via `codex exec`). **agy** drives the Antigravity CLI (default model `gemini-3.1-pro`, dispatched via `agy -p --dangerously-skip-permissions --model`; OAuth auth, no API-key env var). For the codex and agy implementers, valid `--reviewers` are `codex` and `agy`.

```bash
# Generate script for all ready epics (bg backend by default)
ca loop

# Explicit backend selection
ca loop --backend bg     # bg (default): subscription-billed
ca loop --backend p      # p: legacy pay-per-token

# With periodic review every 3 epics
ca loop --reviewers claude-sonnet --review-every 3

# Target specific epics
ca loop --epics "beads-abc,beads-def,beads-ghi" --max-retries 2

# Run it (always use screen for durability)
screen -dmS compound-loop bash ./.compound-agent/infinity-loop.sh
```

**One-time bootstrap (bg backend)**: run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` once interactively to accept the bypass-permissions disclaimer. The generated script's bootstrap preflight detects a missing disclaimer and exits with remediation instructions before starting the loop.

The loop respects beads dependency graphs — it only processes epics whose dependencies are complete. If an epic fails after `--max-retries` attempts, it stops and reports before proceeding.

**Current maturity**: the loop works and has been used to ship real projects, including compound-agent itself. Two things still required human involvement: specifications had to be written before the loop started, and a human applied fixes after the first review pass surfaced real problems (missing error handling, a migration gap, insufficient test coverage). Fully unattended long-duration runs across many epics are the current area of hardening.

## Automatic hooks

Once installed, seven Claude Code hooks fire without any commands:

| Hook | When it fires | What it does |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `SessionStart` | Every new session | Loads high-severity lessons into context before you type anything |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compression | Saves phase state so cook-it survives compaction |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Every prompt | Injects relevant memory items into context |
| `PreToolUse` | During cook-it | Enforces phase gates — prevents jumping ahead |
| `PostToolUse` | After tool success | Clears failure tracking state |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After tool failure | Tracks failures; suggests memory search after repeated errors |
| `Stop` | Session end | Enforces phase gates — prevents skipping required steps |

No configuration needed. `ca setup` wires them into your `.claude/settings.json`.

## `/compound:architect`

AI agents work best on well-scoped problems. When a task exceeds what fits comfortably in one context window, quality degrades — not from lack of capability but from too many competing concerns pulling in different directions.

`/compound:architect` addresses this before the cook-it cycle begins. It takes a large system description and produces cook-it-ready epics via a structured 4-phase process:

1. **Socratic** — builds a domain glossary and discovery mindmap; classifies decisions by reversibility
2. **Spec** — produces system-level EARS requirements, C4 architecture diagrams, and a scenario table
3. **Decompose** — runs 6 parallel subagents (bounded context mapping, dependency analysis, scope sizing, interface design, STPA hazard analysis, structural-semantic gap analysis) then synthesises into a proposed epic structure
4. **Materialise** — creates beads epics with scope boundaries, interface contracts, and wired dependencies
5. **Orchestrate** — two implementation modes for driving the materialised epics through cook-it. **(A) Detached infinity loop**: the `ca loop` script run in a `screen` session, processing epics autonomously with no in-session involvement. **(B) Live orchestration**: the architect model stays in the conversation and autonomously drives each epic through `/compound:cook-it` sequentially in dependency order, tracking progress via a beads-backed checklist note (resumable) and reporting at the end. Polish is a separate opt-in post-loop phase, not an implementation mode.

Three human approval gates separate the phases. Each output epic is sized for one cook-it cycle and includes an EARS subset for traceability back to the system spec. Live orchestration is entered through Phase 5 — there is no separate slash command.

```bash
/compound:architect "Build a data pipeline: ingestion, transformation, storage, and API layer"
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install as dev dependency
pnpm add -D compound-agent

# One-shot setup (creates dirs, hooks, templates)
npx ca setup
```

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 18 (for `npx` wrapper — the CLI itself is a Go binary)
- ~278MB disk space for the embedding model (one-time download, shared across projects)
- Embedding runs via `ca-embed` Rust daemon (nomic-embed-text-v1.5 ONNX)

### Windows Users

Compound-agent runs natively on Windows (amd64 and arm64). Install and use it the same way as on macOS/Linux:

```bash
pnpm add -D compound-agent
npx ca setup
```

**Note**: The embedding daemon (`ca-embed`) is not available on Windows. Search automatically falls back to keyword-only mode (FTS5). All other features work identically. WSL2 users get full functionality including vector search.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from mem0?**
A: mem0 is a cloud memory layer for general AI agents. Compound Agent is local-first with git-tracked storage and local embeddings — no API keys or cloud services needed. It also goes beyond memory with structured workflows, multi-agent review, and issue tracking.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: Yes, completely. Embeddings run locally via the `ca-embed` Rust daemon (nomic-embed-text-v1.5 ONNX). No network requests after the initial model download.

**Q: How much disk space does it need?**
A: ~278MB for the embedding model (one-time download, shared across projects) plus negligible space for lessons.

**Q: Can I use it with other AI coding tools?**
A: The CLI (`ca`) works standalone with any tool. Full hook integration is available for Claude Code. The Antigravity CLI (`agy`) is now the engine that replaces the standalone gemini CLI (whose usage was removed); `ca setup --harness agy` installs an `AGENTS.md` for it and `ca loop --implementer agy` drives the loop with it.

**Q: What happens if the embedding model isn't available?**
A: Search gracefully falls back to keyword-only mode. Other commands that require embeddings will tell you what's missing. Run `ca doctor` to diagnose issues.

**Q: Is the loop production-ready?**
A: The loop works and has been used to ship real projects, including compound-agent itself. Long-duration autonomous runs across many epics are the current area of hardening. For 3–5 epic sequences, it is reliable today.

Three layers work together:
